## SampleTests

This folder contains sample test cases that show the use of the BananaApps Test Framework.

The BananaApps Test Framework is used to determine whether a BananaApp is working as expected, or to test if everything is working as before after some modification to the BananaApp. The documentation of the BananaApp Test Framework is found [here](https://www.banana.ch/doc9/en/node/9026).
