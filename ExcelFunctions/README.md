# ExcelSync Functions
Excel User Defined functions that allow to retrieve data from Banana Accounting into Excel cells (for more information see [ExcelSync functions](https://www.banana.ch/doc9/en/node/4999)).

* **BananaSync.xlsm**: Excel file with example Visual Basic User Defined Functions.
* **BananaSyncUseAll.xlsm**: Excel file with examples for how to use all functions. 
* **BananaSync.bas**: file with the User defined functions. Use this to add the User Defined Functions to an excisting Excel file. 
* **BananaFunctions.zip**: compressed (zipped) folder that include all the necessary files to test the functionalities (Excel and accounting files examples).  

Limitations:
* Compatible with Excel 2013 and 2016 for Windows.
* Compatible with Banana Accounting 8 and 9.

Work in progress to overcome the Mac differences that do not allow to connect to the Banana integrated web server.
