# Sample Translations

This folder contains a sample extention for translating strings in javascript
and qml files using a CMakeLists.txt project.

Content:

- translations.js: the extention.
- Dialog.qml: a dialog used by the extention.
- translations.pro: the project used to update and release the translations.
- translations.qrc: the resource file for creating the extention's package.
    It is also used to list the files to be parsed for strings marked for translations.
