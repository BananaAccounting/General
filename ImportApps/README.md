#Import template

Script that allows the user to import data from CSV file to the Banana document.

The user can define:
* the parameters for the conversion of the CSV file
* the fields of the csv/table
* eventually the conversion of the accounts/categories
* eventually add functions that perform desired tasks

The purpose is to create an import template script that is easy to modify/customize (where required).
